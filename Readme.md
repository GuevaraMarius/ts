## Concepts Covered

### 1. **Types**
   - **Description**: 
     Types in TypeScript allow you to define the shape and nature of your variables, function parameters, and return values.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Basic Types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`)

### 2. **Interfaces**
   - **Description**:
     Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure that objects or classes must adhere to. They are used to enforce consistency across your code by ensuring that objects have specific properties with defined types.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Defining and implementing interfaces
     - Using interfaces to type-check objects

### 3. **Generics**
   - **Description**:
     Generics provide a way to create reusable components that work with multiple data types. They allow you to write flexible and reusable code while maintaining type safety.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Creating generic functions and classes
     - Using generics with different types
     
### 4. **Decorators**
   - **Description**:
     Decorators are special functions that can modify the behavior of classes, methods, or properties. 
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Method decorators
     - Applying and using decorators in classes

### 5. **Enums**
   - **Description**:
     Enums in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants. They make your code more readable and maintainable by providing meaningful names for constant values.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Defining and using enums
     - Practical use cases for enums

### 6. **Tuples**
   - **Description**:
     Tuples allow you to define an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. They are useful for grouping related values, especially when the values are of different types.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Defining and using tuples
     - Accessing and manipulating tuple elements
